                <h3>Battle of Dezful, Iran-Iraq War, 1981</h3>
                <p>
                    The Chieftain was designed to play a defensive role against Soviet armour in a possible Warsaw Pact
                    invasion of Europe, instead the Middle East was where the Chieftain would see all of its operation
                    experience. It was first used by Iran during the Iran-Iraq War (1980). Chieftain Mk3 & 5s were used
                    with mixed results as many suffered from engine problems due to the L60 engine and poor
                    power-to-weight ratio due to how heavy the tank is. This made the Chieftain unreliable and prone to
                    engine breakdowns.
                    <br><br>
                    In Jan 1981, Operation Nasr (aka Operation Hoveyzeh) was launched with the aim to lift the siege on
                    Abadan and force the Iraqi army back towards their border. Before the 1979 Iran Revolution, Iran was
                    one of the 6 Middle Eastern countries that bought the Chieftain. Many officers of the Iranian army
                    were purged after the revolution which left them short of experienced & competent commanders.
                    <br><br>
                    After a brief barrage of artillery fire including ~200 Chieftains & 100 M60 tanks, the Iranian army
                    crossed the Karkheh river via pontoon bridge. Being the wet season, the ground was marshy which
                    forced the Chieftains to move on an exposed road putting the chieftains at a severe disadvantage.
                    This slow progress allowed Iraqi forces to set-up nearby and set up an ambush for the Iranian column
                    of tanks. Failing to recon their route, the Iranians set off the trap. Firing at close ranges in
                    prepared positions, the Iraqi T-62s and T-72s were able to inflict heavy casualties on the Iranians.
                    This resulted in a costly defeat for the Iranians, with ~100 tanks destroyed and ~150 captured.
                    <br><br>
                    Captured Chieftains were sent to Baghdad for trials where Britain, having friendly ties with Iraq in
                    the early 1980s, was allowed to assess the Chieftain tanks recovered from the battlefield. It was
                    reported that the Chieftain was not used in a role that it was intended and most losses were due to
                    them being abandoned before they were knocked out. It was also critical of how the Iranians
                    maintained and used the Chieftains in battle.
                    <br><br>
                    In a post war interview, it was said that Iraqi sabot rounds "Went through the front armour of the
                    Chieftain and came out the backside". This caused alarm as arguably, one of the main strengths of
                    the Chieftain aside from its gun is its armour. The outcome of the battle and reports thereafter led
                    to the Stillbrew armour package to be developed and installed as a defensive measure against
                    contemporary Soviet tank rounds.

                <h3>Invasion of Kuwait, Gulf War, 1990</h3>
                <p>
                    In August 1990, Iraq invaded Kuwait and occupied the country within 2 days. Despite months of Iraqi
                    threatening to take military action against Kuwait, the Kuwait army was caught unaware.On the eve of
                    the invasion Kuwait had 143 Chieftain tanks, 37 of which fought at the Battle of the
                    Bridges against Iraqi forces as part of the Kuwaiti 35th Armored Brigade. The 35th failed to block
                    Mutla pass and were ineffective in delaying the Iraqis as they were severely outnumbered. However,
                    they were able to withdraw into Saudi and joined the Joint Command Forces East during the Gulf War.
                    <br><br>
                    Aside from the 35th Armored Brigade, the rest of Kuwait’s Chieftains were destroyed or captured by
                    Iraq after they’ve been abandoned after their ammunition had run out. Post the liberation of Kuwait,
                    the ageing Chieftains were replaced by the Yugoslavian M-84, a modified variant of the Soviet T-72.

                <h3>FV4030/2 Shir (Lion) 1</h3>
                <p>In 1974, Iran ordered 125 Shir 1and 1225 Shir 2 (a Chieftain variant with modified hull, new turret
                    with Chobham composite armour & hydrogas suspension. Development started prior to Shir 1). However,
                    this order was cancelled after the 1979 Iran Revolution. The Shir 1, also known as “4030 Phase 2”
                    formed Phase 2 of the Iranian contract to supply new MBTs with Phase 1 being a supply of improved
                    Chieftains. The Shir 1 had the Chieftain hull front and turret casting. It was meant to be a stopgap
                    design of the Chieftain Mk5. The rear was reconfigured to accept a new turbocharged V12 four-stroke
                    diesel engine, transmission, and cooling group. It also featured an improved bogie suspension. The
                    first vehicle was completed in April 1977 and no deliveries were made when the contract was
                    cancelled in 1979.</p>

                <h3>Khalid (Sword)</h3>
                <p>The Khalid variant of the Chieftain, also known as 4030 Phase 2 Jordan, was part of a sale negotiated
                    with Jordan in 1979 after Iranian contract cancellation. The Khalid was based on the Shir 1 design
                    and also included an Integrated Fire Control System, Tank Laser Sights, and a Day/Night Sight. Out
                    of the 274 sold, 125 were reworked Shir 1s and the remaining were new production tanks. </p>
