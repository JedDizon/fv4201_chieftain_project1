            <h3>Intro</h3>
            <p> The FV4201 Chieftain MBT (Main Battle Tank) was used by the British army from the late 1960s
                all the way into the 1990s. It set a standard in NATO for MBTs by introducing sophisticated rolled
                homogenous armour with an excellent 120mm rifled gun.
                <br><br>
                It was brought in to replace the Centurion tank. Despite being successful,
                there was worry in the west of the Centurion having to fight the IS-3 and T-10, the bigger & heavier
                Soviet designs that went into service after WWII. Britain decided to create a superheavy tank and put a
                large gun on it called the Conqueror. This tank was meant to work alongside the Centurion to take on the
                bigger Soviet tanks while the Centurion would be able to deal with tanks such as the T-54 & T-55.
                <br><br>
                What was soon realised as Centurion was being produced, was that the process to build its replacement
                had to start. They wanted to combine the firepower of the 120mm gun used on the Conqueror with the
                mobility and handling of the Centurion to create the ideal tank. This was part of the thinking in the
                development of the Chieftain.

                    <h3>1</h3>
                    <p>Despite the fact that the British invented the tank and used it to great effect during the final
                        years of WWI, further tank development in Britain was lost after the war due to a lack of money,
                        resources, & the conflicting demands of policing a world wide empire. </p>
                </div>

                <h3>2</h3>
                <p>Germany, however, saw the potential of the tank after being on the end of many tank offensives during
                    WWI. British tank designs lagged behind Germany during WWII in terms of firepower and armour
                    protection, with many suffering from mechanical unreliability.
                    <br><br>
                    The British army doctrine meant that it had different classes of tanks for infantry support and
                    offensive operations. By 1944, Fieldmarshal Montgomery and others were advocating for a universal
                    tank to replace infantry and cruiser classes. However, the idea was not pursued until after WWII had
                    ended.

            <div>
                <h3>3</h3>
                <p>The design of the universal tank began in 1946 under the designated name “A45”, just as the final
                    example of the cruiser tanks, the “Centurion” , was entering service with the British army. The
                    development of the A45 was slow & the concept of the universal tank was compromised when it was
                    found that it was too difficult to modify the design of the A45 for special purpose tasks such as
                    amphibious assault or minesweeping.
                    <br><br>
                    The A45 project was abandoned in 1948 in favour of further development of the Centurion. The
                    Centurion by contrast was able to be adapted for roles envisioned for the concept of the universal
                    tank.

                <h3>4</h3>
                <p>The development to a successor to the Centurion began in 1951 under the name “Medium Tank No 2.” The
                    threat now was posed by the massed armies of the Soviet Union & the Warsaw Pact states. The Soviet
                    block was equipped with thousands of effective medium tanks such as the T-34-85, and heavy tanks
                    such as the IS-3 equipped with a powerful 122mm calibre gun. To counter this, western countries
                    wanted to pursue a strategy of quality over quantity - to rely on a technological advantage over
                    sheer numbers.</p>

                <h3>5</h3>
                <p> However, in the early 1950s, the only NATO tanks producing tanks in large numbers were the United
                    States and Britain. The two countries cooperated in tank design including a desire for a standard
                    main armament. The British and Americans identified the need for a gun that can defeat 120mm of
                    rolled homogenous steel armour inclined at 60° at a range of 2000 yards.
                    <br><br>
                    Joint assessment was completed in 1956 and recommended a 120mm calibre gun with bagged charge
                    ammunition. At this point, the US and British went their separate ways for development as the US
                    army was not convinced with using bagged charge ammunition and preferred a smooth bore gun with a
                    calibre of 90mm.

                <h3>6</h3>
                <p>Leyland motors was appointed as the main design contractor for the new tank designated as “FV4201”.
                    The hull of FV201 was decided to be a cast hull with well sloped armour with a cast turret front
                    with a roof and rear turret section that was rolled plate armour.
                    <br><br>
                    In late 1957, the standardisation committee of NATO determined that all NATO fighting vehicles
                    should be powered with an engine capable of running on a wide range of fuels from diesel to petrol,
                    and even domestic heating oil.

                <h3>7</h3>
                <p> In Jan 1958, a new engine was installed on FV4201 to conform with this new policy - called the
                    “L60”. The L60 multi-fuel engine proved to be the Chieftain’s main drawback. From the very
                    beginning, the Royal Armoured core held severe reservations about this engine, but these were
                    brushed aside. Britain's NATO partners found that the concept of a mulit-fuel engine was impractical
                    and abandoned the idea and many adopted standard diesel engines. Only the British pursued this
                    concept with an unsuitable engine. </p>

                <h3>8</h3>
                <p> Running trials began in early 1960 on roads with the engine speed governed at 1800 RPM. Attempts to
                    run the engine on different fuels also proved troublesome. It was determined that it would take
                    approximately 8 hours to modify the engine to different fuels which proved impractical on the field
                    under combat conditions. Failures were observed from excessive engine vibrations, and overheating of
                    the gearbox to name a few.
                    <br><br>
                    Gunnery trials showed that the performance of the 120mm L11 main gun was very good. Although
                    successful, the trials demonstrated that there were still faults to be fixed before serious
                    production could begin, in particular with the engine and transmission.

                <h3>9</h3>
                <p> The FV4201 Chieftain was accepted into service in 1965 to allow production to start. Over the next 2
                    years, only an extra 35 brake horsepower could be squeezed out of the L60 engine before it equipped
                    the Chieftain Mk1 of which 40 were built. The MK1 was only used for troop trials & training. </p>

                <h3>10</h3>
                <p> The first service model Chieftain models, the Mk2, was delivered to the British army in 1966. The
                    first tank regiment to be equipped with the new MBT was called the “11th Hussars”. </p>

            <div>
                <h3>11</h3>
                <p>The next major variant, the Chieftain Mk3, rolled off the production line in 1969. It featured an
                    improved 650 hp L60 Mk5 engine & many other enhancements. However, it still remained underpowered
                    for a tank that now weighed 53 tons (~48000 kg).
                    <br><br>
                    The L60 still having problems with unreliability meant that many attempts were made to address this.
                    There were four main aspects of engine failure:
