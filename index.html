                <p> The FV4201 Chieftain was an MBT (Main Battle Tank) used by the British army from the late 1960s
                    all the way into the 1990s. It set a standard in NATO for MBTs by introducing sophisticated
                    rolled
                    homogenous armour with an excellent 120mm rifled gun.
                    <br><br>
                    It was brought in to replace the Centurion tank. Despite being successful,
                    there was worry in the west of the Centurion having to fight the IS-3 and T-10, the bigger &
                    heavier
                    Soviet designs that went into service after WWII. Britain decided to create a superheavy tank
                    and
                    put a
                    large gun on it called the Conqueror. This tank was meant to work alongside the Centurion to
                    take on
                    the
                    bigger Soviet tanks while the Centurion would be able to deal with tanks such as the T-54 &
                    T-55.
                    <br><br>
                    What was soon realised as Centurion was being produced, was that the process to build its
                    replacement
                    had to start. They wanted to combine the firepower of the 120mm gun used on the Conqueror with
                    the
                    mobility and handling of the Centurion to create the ideal tank. This was part of the thinking
                    in
                    the
                    development of the Chieftain.

                    <h3>Early Days</h3>
                    <p>Despite the fact that the British invented the tank and used it to great effect during the final
                        years of WWI, further tank development in Britain was lost after the war due to a lack of money,
                        resources, & the conflicting demands of policing a world wide empire.
                        <br><br>
                        Germany, however, saw the potential of the tank after being on the end of many tank offensives
                        during
                        WWI. British tank designs lagged behind Germany during WWII in terms of firepower and armour
                        protection, with many suffering from mechanical unreliability.
                        <br><br>
                        The British army doctrine meant that it had different classes of tanks for infantry support and
                        offensive operations. By 1944, Fieldmarshal Montgomery and others were advocating for a
                        universal
                        tank to replace infantry and cruiser classes. However, the idea was not pursued until after WWII
                        had
                        ended.

                    <h3>Initial Development</h3>
                    <p>The design of the universal tank began in 1946 under the designated name “A45”, just as the final
                        example of the cruiser tanks, the “Centurion” , was entering service with the British army. The
                        development of the A45 was slow & the concept of the universal tank was compromised when it was
                        found that it was too difficult to modify the design of the A45 for special purpose tasks such
                        as
                        amphibious assault or minesweeping.
                        <br><br>
                        The A45 project was abandoned in 1948 in favour of further development of the Centurion. The
                        Centurion by contrast was able to be adapted for roles envisioned for the concept of the
                        universal
                        tank.

                    <h3>The Soviet Threat</h3>
                    <p>The development to a successor to the Centurion began in 1951 under the name “Medium Tank No 2.”
                        The
                        threat now was posed by the massed armies of the Soviet Union & the Warsaw Pact states. The
                        Soviet
                        block was equipped with thousands of effective medium tanks such as the T-34-85, and heavy tanks
                        such as the IS-3 equipped with a powerful 122mm calibre gun. To counter this, western countries
                        wanted to pursue a strategy of quality over quantity - to rely on a technological advantage over
                        sheer numbers.</p>

            <div class="checkpoint">
                <div>
                    <h3>Initial Designs</h3>
                    <p> However, in the early 1950s, the only NATO tanks producing tanks in large numbers were the
                        United
                        States and Britain. The two countries cooperated in tank design including a desire for a
                        standard
                        main armament. The British and Americans identified the need for a gun that can defeat 120mm of
                        rolled homogenous steel armour inclined at 60° at a range of 2000 yards.
                        <br><br>
                        Joint assessment was completed in 1956 and recommended a 120mm calibre gun with bagged charge
                        ammunition. At this point, the US and British went their separate ways for development as the US
                        army was not convinced with using bagged charge ammunition and preferred a smooth bore gun with
                        a
                        calibre of 90mm.

                    <h3>The L60 Engine</h3>
                    <p>Leyland motors was appointed as the main design contractor for the new tank designated as
                        “FV4201”.
                        The hull of FV201 was decided to be a cast hull with well sloped armour with a cast turret front
                        with a roof and rear turret section that was rolled plate armour.
                        <br><br>
                        In late 1957, the standardisation committee of NATO determined that all NATO fighting vehicles
                        should be powered with an engine capable of running on a wide range of fuels from diesel to
                        petrol,
                        and even domestic heating oil.
                        <br><br>
                        In Jan 1958, a new engine was installed on FV4201 to conform with this new policy - called the
                        “L60”. The L60 multi-fuel engine proved to be the Chieftain’s main drawback. From the very
                        beginning, the Royal Armoured core held severe reservations about this engine, but these were
                        brushed aside. Britain's NATO partners found that the concept of a mulit-fuel engine was
                        impractical
                        and abandoned the idea and many adopted standard diesel engines. Only the British pursued this
                        concept with an unsuitable engine.

                    <h3>First Trials</h3>
                    <p> Running trials began in early 1960 on roads with the engine speed governed at 1800 RPM. Attempts
                        to
                        run the engine on different fuels also proved troublesome. It was determined that it would take
                        approximately 8 hours to modify the engine to different fuels which proved impractical on the
                        field
                        under combat conditions. Failures were observed from excessive engine vibrations, and
                        overheating of
                        the gearbox to name a few.
                        <br><br>
                        Gunnery trials showed that the performance of the 120mm L11 main gun was very good. Although
                        successful, the trials demonstrated that there were still faults to be fixed before serious
                        production could begin, in particular with the engine and transmission.

                    <p> The FV4201 Chieftain was accepted into service in 1965 to allow production to start. Over the
                        next 2
                        years, only an extra 35 brake horsepower could be squeezed out of the L60 engine before it
                        equipped
                        the Chieftain Mk1 of which 40 were built. The MK1 was only used for troop trials & training.
                        <br><br>
                        The first service model Chieftain models, the Mk2, was delivered to the British army in 1966.
                        The
                        first tank regiment to be equipped with the new MBT was called the “11th Hussars”.

                    <p>The next major variant, the Chieftain Mk3, rolled off the production line in 1969. It featured an
                        improved 650 hp L60 Mk5 engine & many other enhancements. However, it still remained
                        underpowered
                        for a tank that now weighed 53 tons (~48000 kg).The L60 still having problems with unreliability
                        meant that many attempts were made to address this.
                        <br><br>
                        These problems were eventually fixed, but not before the reputation of the Chieftain’s engine
                        became
                        infamous. Under the engine modification program called “Totem Pole”, the engines of previous Mks
                        of
                        Chieftains were upgraded to the same standard of the final production variant, the Chieftain
                        Mk5.

                    <p>The Chieftain Mk5 was released in 1975. It featured the L60 Mk8A engine of 750 hp with a top
                        speed of
                        30 mph. The Mk5 was the definitive Chieftain tank, weighing in at 55 tonnes - almost 10 times
                        greater than the original requirements.

                        Despite the terrible engine, at the time, it had the best MBT gun and the most heavily armoured
                        in
                        the world, until the introduction of the Leopard 2. The hull armour was welded & cast steel
                        which in
                        combination with its excessive thickness and extreme sloping made it almost impenetrable.

                        examination was undertaken. It was concluded that the front of Chieftain's hull and turret was
                        inadequate. This led to the introduction of the Stillbrew armour package.
                        <br><br>
                        Stillbrew armour consisted of plates of steel-titanium alloy mounted over the cast turret of the
                        tank with a thick layer of rubber in between. In effect, it was an early type of composite
                        armour.
                        It was manufactured in England and used in early 1980 to upgrade the Chieftains as part of a
                        crew
                        protection package.

                    <h3>Further Variants</h3>
                    <p> In British army service, variants of the Chieftain go all the way up to Mk11. Mk1 - 5 were the
                        production Mks, while Mk6 - 11 were improvements on the production variants. Over 1000
                        improvements
                        were done on the Chieftain during its service life. Mk12 and Mk13 upgrades were cancelled due to
                        the
                        introduction of the Challenger 1 in 1983.</p>

                    <p>
                        The Chieftain was sold into the Middle East, the IDF (Israel Defense Force) initially helped
                        with
                        its
                        development as at one point they were planning on buying it. However, the British government
                        decided
                        that it was to side with the Arabs more than the Israelis at the time and didn’t sell to Israel.
                        This also led to the creation of the Merkava tank. The Chieftain was sold to a number of Middle
                        Eastern countries which include Iran, Kuwait, Oman and Jordan.
                        <br> <br>
                        Overall, the Chieftain was a successful design despite its problems with the L60 multi-fuel
                        engine.
                        It served with the British army until 1996 with the introduction of the Challenger 2. It was
                        mainly
                        stationed in the Rhine during the Cold War ready to defend Germany against a possible Warsaw
                        Pact
                        attack.
