Welcome,

This project is about the development of the chieftain mbt. I hope that it can be used as a website where you can go to get an overview on its history. My intended targets are any researcher, student, or just anyone curious. I hope the site serves as a gateway to understand this topic to drill down to more specific information.

Unfixed Bugs
You will need to mention unfixed bugs and why they were not fixed. This section should include shortcomings of the frameworks or technologies used. Although time can be a big variable to consider, paucity of time and difficulty understanding implementation is not a valid reason to leave bugs unfixed.
